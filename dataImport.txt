To import the books data into MongoDB:
a. open a new command line - cd to project directory
1. Make sure mongod is running by typing mongod - you should see it start up concluding with "waiting for connections on port 27017"
2. type: mongo bookAPI < booksJSON.js

Mongo will spew a bit and say inserted 10 lines
